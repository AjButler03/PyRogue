PyRogue in red, the menus in gold (roll clones)
Source engine style indentation, because why not

start game starts the game, rather intuitively.
settings controls dungeon size and game difficulty; If I'm adventurous, I could even make controls settings; but that would be much, much later.
instructions will have a page for 'lore' (short blurb) with game mechanic explanations, then another page for controls
the encyclopedias will have unigue pages for each monster / item, all in the same format to display what they are.

Welcome, traveler.

PyRogue is a game about resourcefulness and survival - the dungeon you find yourself in
is not a forgiving place, and plenty of monsters hide in the shadows. In order to survive,
you will need to scavange for helpful objects and be observent about the creatures you find.

Knowledge of the items you yield and the creatures you encounter might make the difference
between making it out alive and becoming part of the decor.

This manual aims to help you gain that knowledge.

/_/  /_/\___/_//_/___/\__/\__/_/ /___/

Not all of the monsters lurking in the dungeon are the same; they have
different attributes, which modify how a specific monster behaves in the dungeon.
By default, a monster must see the player, stay within rooms/corridors, and moves
in a straight line. These are the possible attributes:

  INTELLIGENT: Monster follows optimal path, and can remember the player's location.
  TELEPATHIC: Monster always knows the player's location.
  TUNNEL: Monster can bore through rock, creating new paths between rooms.
  ERRATIC: On each turn, monster has a 50% chance to ignore its path and move randomly.
  UNIQUE: There will only be 1 at a time, and if it dies, it will not spawn again.
  BOSS: Killing a boss monster wins the game.

See the monster encyclopedia for the specific types of monsters that you might see.

  /  _/ /____ __ _  ___
 _/ // __/ -_)  ' \(_-<
/___/\__/\__/_/_/_/___/             

Scattered throughout the dungeon you will find various items that will help you 
survive; these include potions, melee weapons, ranged weapons, offhand equipment, 
armor, amulets, light sources, and rings.

You have inventory space for up to ten items; with the exception of potions, you can
equip slots to 'use' the items. You can equip one ring on each hand, and only one of
every other type of equipable items. Potions have instantanious effects upon the player,
and their usage per turn is only limited by the amount that you are carrying.

See the item encyclopedia for the different items to keep an eye out for.

This one has to scroll, so that makes this one a bit more complicated. 
I'm going to worry about the first three first.
