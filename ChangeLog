v04 ===========================================================================================================================
06/17/2025
    - Added error checking where no optimal move based on path found; now results in no move instead of crash
06/18/2025
    - Created a dungeon render using tkinter library
    - Implemented custom scaling of dungeon render, so user can quickly adjust window size
    - Refactored code to create pyrogue_game class, which will handle game logic.
    - Updated pyrogue_game renderer to include actors + display automated turnloop
06/19/2025
    - Refactored turnloop to allow tkinter's mainloop to update in between turns; this fixed dynamic scaling while loop running
    - Renamed classes to be capitalized
    - Implemented player movement controls
    - Optimized dungeon renderer + added solid border around dungeon
v03 ===========================================================================================================================
06/04/2025
    - Start v03; update ChangeLog + README
    - Monster Class + monster generation method
06/05/2025
    - Laid some groundwork for actors to have turn methods, as well as death detection
06/09/2025
    - PC random movement
06/10/2025
    - Started on primary game loop, or the discrete-event simulation. All automated, random movement for now.
    - Both the PC and the monsters now move in turn based on priority queue
    - PC and monsters can now 'kill' each other by moving into space that another occupies
06/11/2025
    - Cleaned up actor/player/monster classes a bit
    - Start on monster attributes implementation
06/14/2025
    - Monsters now have a method to check if they have a line of sight on the pc
    - Monsters now have a method to calculate a straightline path to the player character
06/15/2025
    - Starting on monster path-based movement and setting up better combat management
06/16/2025
    - Finished writing 'correct' monster movement code; currently not working correctly
06/17/2025
    - Fixed several bugs with monster path movement
    - Implemented a basic combat dialogue; will be more useful later on
v02 ===========================================================================================================================
05/31/2025
    - Start v02; update ChangeLog + README
    - Init pyrogue.py as the main file to run
06/02/2025
    - Added methods to display walking/tunneling distance maps
    - Implemented walking distance calculation
    - Implemented tunneling distance calculation
06/03/2025
    - Init actor.py; only basic player class implemented
06/04/2025
    - Created actor class (abstract), which player class inherits from
    - Created proper actor map to store actor locations
    - pyrogue.py now has render method to show terrain and actor positions
v01 ===========================================================================================================================
05/20/2025
    - Starting this Project
05/21/2025
    - Created dungeon terrain print method for testing
    - Working on creating methods to generate dungeons
05/22/2025
    - Room generation done
    - Rockmap generation start
05/23/2025
    - Rockmap generation; original + faster version
05/27/2025
    - First pass at dijkstra corridor generation; not strictly correct at the moment
05/29/2025
    - Moved from heapq to custom priorityqueue implementation
05/30/2025
    - Room generation improved to be a little more random in room count (generation is slower as a result)
    - Staircases are now generated (at least one for every 2 rooms)
