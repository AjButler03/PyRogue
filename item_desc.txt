PYROGUE ITEM DESCRIPTION FILE

A couple of notes: any lines not contained between "BEGIN ITEM" and "END" will be ignored. So, comments like this are possible.
Items will have all of the fields listed below. Playing around will give you a good idea of how these are defined and work within the dungeon.
Probably the most initially confusing aspect will be dice, and how they are defined in this file.
Dice act to randomize the aspects of items, and are expressed like 10+2d6, i.e., {base value}+{number of dice / dice rolls}d{Sides to die}.

Other note: COLOR can be specified as multiple colors, which will be randomly looped between. They just need to be any valid Tkinter color keyword.

I have also attempted to group the different item types into their own categories.
