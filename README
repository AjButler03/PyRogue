PyRogue v0.05 By Andrew Butler, Summer 2025
Built to run using Python 3.12

pyrogue.py is the main file, and running it will do the following:
    - A new window for PyRogue will open, with a simple message at the top, followed by the dungeon display, then a couple more information labels
    - The PyRogue window can be scaled to whatever size you would like, and the contents will grow / shrink to fill the space as best it can
    - Pressing any key will start the game; your goal is to 'kill' all monsters by moving into the space they occupy. The monsters are attempting to do the same to you.
    - The PyRogue Game ends when either you are defeated, or all the monsters are defeated.

New features with v0.05:
    - Main menu with following features:
        - Game launcher, allowing several games to be played without re-executing PyRogue.py.
        - Settings page, allowing user to select from dungeon size and game difficulty options
        - Manual page, displaying information about PyRogue gameplay and controls.
        - Quit, which closes the PyRogue from the UI instead of force quitting the window
    - Monster list sub-menu in game?
    - Walk/tunnel distance map display?

The game has the following key binds:
================================   MOVEMENT   ================================
  7 or y : Attempt to move PC one cell to the upper left.
  8 or k : Attempt to move PC one cell up.
  9 or u : Attempt to move PC one cell to the upper right.

Descriptions of the attributes that the monsters can have (Those that are implemented as of v03):
    - INTELLIGENT: An intelligent monster follows the optimal route to the player, and remembers where the player was when it last saw them.
    - TELEPATHIC: A telepathic monster will always know where the player character is, regardless of distance or line of sight.
    - TUNNEL: A tunneling monster has the ability to bore through rock, creating new paths between rooms.
    - ERRATIC: On any given turn, an erratic monster will have a 50% chance to move randomly.

Known Issues:
    - Monsters attempting to move into other monsters around the player might result in the player being removed from the map temporarily, resulting in immortality.
