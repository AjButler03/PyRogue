PyRogue v01 By Andrew Butler, Summer 2025

The goal of this project is to recreate a rogue-like game I built in C/C++ for a class at Iowa State University in Python. 
This will a) allow me to build this without the same pressure of deadlines, 
          b) implement some choice changes that I think are better, and 
          c) gain experience building software in Python, particularly with a UI.

My versions will loosely follow the original assignment structure used in the university class.
I also acknowledge that building this in python removes dynamic memory management as a consideration, but taking advantage of Python's built in features doesn't seem like a bad thing to me.
v01 involves dungeon generation, with variable dungeon size and room count, with Dijkstra algorithm corridor generation.

Simply running the program will generate a dungeon, displaying the number of rooms, the number of attempted room placements, then the dungeon terrain followed by the dungeon's rockmap.
