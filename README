PyRogue v0.05 By Andrew Butler, Summer 2025
Built to run using Python 3.12

pyrogue.py is the main file, and running it will open a new window with the PyRogue main menu.

New features with v0.05:
    - Main menu with following features:
        - Game launcher, allowing several games to be played without re-executing PyRogue.py.
        - Settings page, allowing user to select from dungeon size and game difficulty options
        - Quit, which closes the PyRogue from the UI instead of force quitting the window
    - Game now has a 'pause' menu, allowing pause of game input + options to end game/quit.
    - Render modes for the main copies of the walking/tunneling distance maps.

The game has the following key binds:
================================   MOVEMENT   ================================

  8 or k : Attempt to move PC one cell up.

    - TELEPATHIC: Always know where the player character is, regardless of distance or line of sight.
    - TUNNEL: Ability to bore through rock, creating new paths between rooms.
