PyRogue v04 By Andrew Butler, Summer 2025
Built to run using Python 3.12

pyrogue.py is the main file, and running it will do the following:
    - A new window for PyRogue will open, with a simple message at the top, followed by the dungeon display, then a couple more information labels
    - The PyRogue window can be scaled to whatever size you would like, and the contents will grow / shrink to fill the space as best it can
    - Pressing any key will start the game; your goal is to 'kill' all monsters by moving into the space they occupy. The monsters are attempting to do the same to you.
    - The PyRogue Game ends when either you are defeated, or all the monsters are defeated.

New features with v05:
    - Main menu with instructions page
    - Ability to replay without restarting pyrogue
    - Settings options?
    - Monster list sub-menu in game?
    - Walk/tunnel distance map display?

The game has the following key binds:
================================   MOVEMENT   ================================
  7 or y : Attempt to move PC one cell to the upper left.
  8 or k : Attempt to move PC one cell up.
  9 or u : Attempt to move PC one cell to the upper right.
  4 or h : Attempt to move PC one cell to the left.
  5 or space or . : Rest for a turn NPCs still move.
  6 or l : Attempt to move PC one cell to the right.
  1 or b : Attempt to move PC one cell to the lower left.
  2 or j : Attempt to move PC one cell down.
  3 or n : Attempt to move PC one cell to the lower right.

Descriptions of the attributes that the monsters can have (Those that are implemented as of v03):
    - INTELLIGENT: An intelligent monster follows the optimal route to the player, and remembers where the player was when it last saw them.
    - TELEPATHIC: A telepathic monster will always know where the player character is, regardless of distance or line of sight.
    - TUNNEL: A tunneling monster has the ability to bore through rock, creating new paths between rooms.
    - ERRATIC: On any given turn, an erratic monster will have a 50% chance to move randomly.
