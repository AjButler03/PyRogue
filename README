PyRogue v04 By Andrew Butler, Summer 2025
Built to run using Python 3.12

-- About --
In the spring semester of 2025 I built a rogue-like game as a series of assignments for a programming course at Iowa State University. 
The original was built in C/C++, and had many unoptimized / poorly written aspects to it. Regardless, I was proud of having built it from scratch myself. The goal of this project is to build (roughly) the same game, but written in Python.
My reasons for doing this:
    a) I think it is easier to showcase and run python code to people, making it a better showpiece.
    b) I want to gain more experience programming full projects in python, given that it is decently widely used.
    c) Re-building the game allows me to implement optimizations and choice changes that I believe are 'better'.
On point a in particular, I want this code to only rely on Python itself to be runable. In doing so, it is easily shared and ran by whoever would want to play the game or see how it works.

pyrogue.py is the main file, and running it will do the following:
    - New UI Stuff; PLEASE UPDATE THIS, FUTURE ME

New features with v04:
    - User interface created via tkinker library, with options to display walking/ tunneling distance maps
    - Player character movement, as controlled by the player (keyboard input)
    - Monster list menu to display monsters in dungeon

Descriptions of the attributes that the monsters can have (Those that are implemented as of v03):
    - INTELLIGENT: An intelligent monster follows the optimal route to the player, and remembers where the player was when it last saw them.
    - TELEPATHIC: A telepathic monster will always know where the player character is, regardless of distance or line of sight.
    - TUNNEL: A tunneling monster has the ability to bore through rock, creating new paths between rooms.
    - ERRATIC: On any given turn, an erratic monster will have a 50% chance to move randomly.
