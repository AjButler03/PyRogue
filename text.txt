PyRogue in red, the menus in gold (roll clones)
Source engine style indentation, because why not

start game starts the game, rather intuitively.
settings controls dungeon size and game difficulty; If I'm adventurous, I could even make controls settings; but that would be much, much later.
instructions will have a page for 'lore' (short blurb) with game mechanic explanations, then another page for controls
the encyclopedias will have unigue pages for each monster / item, all in the same format to display what they are.
