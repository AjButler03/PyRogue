PYROGUE MANUAL PAGES TEXT FILE

This is a file to easily write manual pages, so that I can edit them here and then just read from this file.
I figure that also makes more sense than hard-coding large amounts of text to be displayed.

Multiple pages can be defined with BEGIN PAGE and END PAGE, allowing users to move between them.
Pages will have limited width of ~80 characters to keep things uniform between the pages, but unlimited length.

BEGIN PAGE
Introduction
Welcome the player, introduce them to the goal and main mechanics.
Wish them luck.
END PAGE

BEGIN PAGE
Monsters
Describe monsters and their potential abilities.
END PAGE


BEGIN PAGE
Items
Describe the different item types, their purpose, and bonuses.
Inventory space/ management.
END PAGE

BEGIN PAGE
Controls
END PAGE
