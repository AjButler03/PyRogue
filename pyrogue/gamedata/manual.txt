PYROGUE MANUAL PAGES TEXT FILE

This is a file to easily write manual pages, so that I can edit them here and then just read from this file.
I figure that also makes more sense than hard-coding large amounts of text to be displayed.

Multiple pages can be defined with BEGIN PAGE and END PAGE, allowing users to move between them.
Pages will have limited width of ~80 characters to keep things uniform between the pages, but unlimited length.

BEGIN PAGE

Welcome to PyRogue.

This is a rogue-like dungeon crawling game, where your goal is to stay alive.
If you do that well enough, you might defeat the dungeon boss, securing victory.

But don't get ahead of yourself - the dungeon is dark, and filled with plenty
of monsters that want to end you. You can't win with just your bare hands.

You need to scavange for weapons and equipment, which will be scattered around.
You are capable of carrying 10 items in inventory, and have specific equip slots.
They are WEAPON, RANGED, OFFHAND, ARMOR, AMULET, RING LEFT, RING RIGHT, and LIGHT.

LIGHT items will allow you to pierce the darkness of the dungeon better; the
others can boost the damage you deal, reduce the damage you take, and will 
generally improve your chances.

Be sure to keep an eye on your surroundings, understand the enemies to avoid, 
and the items to make a run for. Your success is up to you.

Good luck.

Knowing the monsters of PyRogue is important- some will be easy to take down,
others less so. Being able to differentiate between the easy to kill and the
unstoppable killing machines will be life and death.

All monsters will spawn with some amount of health, and will have a dice object
to determine how much raw damage they deal. They will also have defined attributes
that determine how they behave in the dungeon.

All dice in PyRogue, including the damage dice for monsters, are defined as having
a base value followed by some number of rolls of an x-sided die.
For example, 10+2d6 represents a base value of 10, which is then added to the result
of 2 rolls of a 6 sided die.
The basic format, then, is {base}+{Number of rolls}d{number of sides to die}.

The starting hitpoints of a monster are also determined by dice roll, as defined by
the monster's type definition. All monster type definitions are viewable in the 
Monster Encyclopedia.

Attributes are also defined by the monster's type definition. Any definition may
have any combination of the attributes, creating a wide variety of behaviors.

There are 5 individual attributes that monsters can have:
    - INTELLIGENT: Monster follows optimal path to the player, and can remember 
                   the location of the player.
    - TELEPATHIC:  Monster always knows where the player character is, regardless of 
                   distance or line of sight.
    - TUNNEL:      Monster can bore through rock, creating new paths between rooms.
    - ERRATIC:     On every turn, 50% chance to move randomly.
    - PASS:        Monster can move through rock without boring.
    - PICKUP:      Monster will pick up items, placing them into inventory. Monster
                   has limited inventory, and will drop a single picked up item from
                   its inventory on death (assuming it has one to drop). All other
                   held items are destroyed.
    - DESTROY:     Monster will destroy any items it comes across.

Scavenging for items is essential in preparing yourself for fighting the toughest
enemies in the dungeon. A good weapon will be a life and death matter.

Many aspects of items will have values determined by dice rolls.
All dice in PyRogue are defined as having a base value followed by some number of 
rolls of an x-sided die. For example, 10+2d6 represents a base value of 10, which is 
then added to the result of 2 rolls of a 6 sided die.
The basic format, then, is {base}+{Number of rolls}d{number of sides to die}.

There are 9 possible item types, each filling a different role. Specific item
definitions can be found in the Item Encyclopedia.

Potions (symbol: ! )
    These are consumable items that, on use, will give you some sort of bonus.
    Possible effects (any combination of the following):
        - Hitpoint restoration
        - Permanent hitpoint capacity increase
        - Permanent defense bonus
        - Permanent dodge bonus
    As a consumable, potions will be destroyed upon use.

Weapons (symbol: | )
    These are basic short range weapons that boost melee damage to enemies.
    They may restore hitpoints, and/or grant bonuses to speed, defense, and 
    dodge values, but not always. These might be the most important item to get
    early, so that you can defeat enemies quickly before they deal significant damage.
    May restore hitpoints upon equip.
  
Ranged (symbol: } )
    Like normal weapons, ranged weapons (listed as "RANGED" in menus) allow you to deal 
    damage to enemies. The difference is that they can be used to attack monsters from
    a distance, which helps you avoid damage. The caveat is that they consume ammunition,
    which must also be scavanged for.
    May restore hitpoints upon equip.

Ammo (symbol: # )
    These are consumables that will increase your ammunition count upon use.
    As a consumable, Ammo items will be destroyed upon use.

Offhand (symbol: ) )
    Objects, like shields, that are wielded in your non-dominant hand. They typically
    prioritize granting a defensive bonus, but can be used to inflict melee damage as well.
    May restore hitpoints upon equip.

Armor (symbol: [ )
    Clothing that is ideally protective, granting defensive bonuses.
    May restore hitpoints upon equip.
  
Amulets (symbol: " )
    Neckware that can apply a variety of bonuses, both offensive and defensive.
    May restore hitpoints upon equip.

Rings (symbol: = )
    Rings are much like amulets, in that they apply a variety of bonuses, both
    offensive and defenseive. They are unique in that they are the only item 
    that the player can equip two of- one for each hand.
    May restore hitpoints upon equip.

Lights (symbol: _ )
    Lights are the only item that benefits the player's view distance, or your 
    ability to pierce the 'fog of war'.
