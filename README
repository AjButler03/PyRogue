PyRogue v02 By Andrew Butler, Summer 2025
Built to run using Python 3.12

Running pyrogue.py will do the following:
    - Generate a dungeon (currently hardcoded to 20 * 80 char size)
    - generate a 'player character', represented by a @, and place in dungeon
    - Calculate distance maps for walking and tunneling in dungeon to @
    - Display the dungeon terrain, rock hardness map, walking distance map, then tunneling distance map

New features with v02 include player character placement and distance map calculation.
