PyRogue v1.00 By Andrew Butler
Built to run using Python 3.12 & Tkinter library

To run and play PyRogue, you will need to navigate to the folder with all the associated files
in a terminal and run pyrogue.py with Python. It's important to run pyrogue.py from the same
directory as the other files, so that it can access dependencies. Once the file is running,
it should open up a separate window displaying the main menu.

From there, you can navigate the menu using the arrow keys or using the movement keys below.
You will have the option to start a game, alter game settings, view the game manual, view
monster and item descriptions for monsters/items that will appear in the game, or quit.
For more information on the game itself, be sure to check out the game manual.
Have fun!

Known Issues:
  - The game does not instantly end when win conditions are met.

  - Item / Monster definition parser does not allow negative values, nor does it account for x+yd0. (0-sided dice).
