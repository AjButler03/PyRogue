PyRogue v04 By Andrew Butler, Summer 2025
Built to run using Python 3.12

-- About --
In the spring semester of 2025 I built a rogue-like game as a series of assignments for a programming course at Iowa State University. 
The original was built in C/C++, and had many unoptimized / poorly written aspects to it. Regardless, I was proud of having built it from scratch myself. The goal of this project is to build (roughly) the same game, but written in Python.
My reasons for doing this:
    a) I think it is easier to showcase and run python code to people, making it a better showpiece.
    b) I want to gain more experience programming full projects in python, given that it is decently widely used.
    c) Re-building the game allows me to implement optimizations and choice changes that I believe are 'better'.
On point a in particular, I want this code to only rely on Python itself to be runable. In doing so, it is easily shared and ran by whoever would want to play the game or see how it works.

pyrogue.py is the main file, and running it will do the following:
    - A new window for PyRogue will open, with a simple message at the top, followed by the dungeon display, then a couple more information labels
    - The PyRogue window can be scaled to whatever size you would like, and the contents will grow / shrink to fill the space as best it can
    - Pressing any key will start the game; your goal is to 'kill' all monsters by moving into the space they occupy. The monsters are attempting to do the same to you.
    - The PyRogue Game ends when either you are defeated, or all the monsters are defeated.

New features with v04:
    - User interface created via tkinker library
    - Player character movement, as controlled by the player (keyboard input)
    - Player can now escape to a new dungeon level via staircases (>)

The game has the following key binds:
================================   MOVEMENT   ================================
  7 or y : Attempt to move PC one cell to the upper left.
  8 or k : Attempt to move PC one cell up.
  9 or u : Attempt to move PC one cell to the upper right.
  4 or h : Attempt to move PC one cell to the left.
  5 or space or . : Rest for a turn NPCs still move.
  6 or l : Attempt to move PC one cell to the right.
  1 or b : Attempt to move PC one cell to the lower left.
  2 or j : Attempt to move PC one cell down.
  3 or n : Attempt to move PC one cell to the lower right.
  > or 0 : attempt to escape to new dungeon level using a staircase.

Descriptions of the attributes that the monsters can have (Those that are implemented as of v03):
    - INTELLIGENT: An intelligent monster follows the optimal route to the player, and remembers where the player was when it last saw them.
    - TELEPATHIC: A telepathic monster will always know where the player character is, regardless of distance or line of sight.
    - TUNNEL: A tunneling monster has the ability to bore through rock, creating new paths between rooms.
    - ERRATIC: On any given turn, an erratic monster will have a 50% chance to move randomly.
