PYROGUE MONSTER DESCRIPTION FILE

A couple of notes: any lines not contained between "BEGIN MONSTER" and "END" will be ignored. So, comments like this are possible.
Monsters will have all of the fields listed below. Playing around will give you a good idea of how these are defined and work within the dungeon.

Probably the most initially confusing aspect will be dice, and how they are defined in this file.
Dice act to randomize the aspects of monsters, and are expressed like 10+2d6, i.e., {base value}+{number of dice / dice rolls}d{Sides to die}.

Other note: COLOR can be specified as multiple colors, which will be randomly looped between. They just need to be any valid Tkinter color keyword.

NAME Junior Barbarian
SYMB p
COLOR yellow
DESC
This is a junior barbarian.  He--or is it she?  You can't tell for sure--
looks like... it should still be in barbarian school.  The barbarians are 
putting them in the dungeons young these days.  It's wearing dirty, tattered
cloth armor and wielding a wooden sword.  You have a hard time feeling
intimidated.

BEGIN MONSTER
NAME Amazon Lich Queen
DESC
She was a powerful Amazon warrior in life.  Death at the hands of the undead
hordes was followed by her resurrection through dark, necromantic arts.  Her
power in life didn't approach her undead glory.  Clad in night-black robes
that don't move in the wind, her incorporeal form commands the power of death
over life.  You may just be her next victim.  You fear for your soul as you
quake before her malevolent majesty.

NAME Titan
DESC
Looming over you at a massive 15 feet tall, weighing nearly a ton, the
Titan is a force to be reckoned with. A mighty oak club is his weapon of
choice, but you are all too aware it would take no more than a flick of
the wrist for him to shatter every bone in your body.

DESC
Casper, the friendly ghost, 
The friendliest ghost you know. 
Though grown-ups might 
Look at him with fright, 
The children all love him so. 

He always says hello, 
and he's really glad to meetcha. 
Wherever he may go, 
He's kind to every living creature. 

Grown-ups don't understand 
Why children love him the most. 
But kids all know 
That he loves them so, 
Casper the friendly ghost.

DESC
Some really old skool tech that might go over your head.  It's kind of like 
Powerpoint, but without computers.  You've probably never seen one before 
(unless you 1) are old; or 2) have taken a music class).  If you get attacked
by one of these, make sure to block high.
