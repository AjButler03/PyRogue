PyRogue v03 By Andrew Butler, Summer 2025
Built to run using Python 3.12

-- About --
In the spring semester of 2025 I built a rogue-like game as a series of assignments for a programming course at Iowa State University. 
The original was built in C/C++, and had many unoptimized / poorly written aspects to it. Regardless, I was proud of having built it from scratch myself. The goal of this project is to build (roughly) the same game, but written in Python.
My reasons for doing this:
    a) I think it is easier to showcase and run python code to people. 
    b) I want to gain more experience programming full projects in python, given that it is decently widely used.
    c) Re-building the game allows me to implement optimizations and choice changes that I believe are 'better'.
    d) I can share this code, since it cannot be directly used to solve the assignments from the aforementioned programming course.
On point a in particular, I want this code to only rely on Python itself to be runable. In doing so, it is easily shared and ran by whoever would want to play the game or see how it works.

pyrogue.py is the main file, and running it will do the following:
    - Generate a dungeon (currently hardcoded to 20 * 80 char size)
    - generate a 'player character', represented by a @, and place in dungeon
    - Calculate distance maps for walking and tunneling in dungeon to @
    - Display the dungeon terrain, rock hardness map, walking distance map, tunneling distance map, then standard dungeon render

New features with v03 include monsters and a turnloop for movement, although it is completely automated for now.

Descriptions of the attributes that the monsters can have (Those that are implemented as of v03):
    - INTELLIGENT: This indicates that the monster understands the optimal route to the player character, or at least to where they think the player is.
      Intelligent monsters also remember where the player is, assuming that they obtain the player's location in the first place.
    - TELEPATHIC: A telepathic monster will always know where the player character is, regardless of distance or line of sight.
    - TUNNEL: A tunneling monster has the ability to bore through rock, creating new paths between rooms. It does take extra time to bore through the rock, though.
    - ERRATIC: On any given turn, an erratic monster will have a 50% chance to move randomly. Otherwise it moves normally.
