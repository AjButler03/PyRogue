PYROGUE MANUAL PAGES TEXT FILE

This is a file to easily write manual pages, so that I can edit them here and then just read from this file.
I figure that also makes more sense than hard-coding large amounts of text to be displayed.

Multiple pages can be defined with BEGIN PAGE and END PAGE, allowing users to move between them.
Pages will have limited width of ~80 characters to keep things uniform between the pages, but unlimited length.

BEGIN PAGE

Welcome to PyRogue.

This is a rogue-like dungeon crawling game, where your goal is to stay alive.
If you do that well enough, you might defeat the dungeon boss, securing victory.

But don't get ahead of yourself - the dungeon is dark, and filled with plenty
of monsters that want to end you. You can't win with just your bare hands.

You need to scavange for weapons and equipment, which will be scattered around.
You are capable of carrying 10 items in inventory, and have specific equip slots.
They are WEAPON, RANGED, OFFHAND, ARMOR, AMULET, RING LEFT, RING RIGHT, and LIGHT.

LIGHT items will allow you to pierce the darkness of the dungeon better; the
others can boost the damage you deal, reduce the damage you take, and even make 
you faster and more nimble. Unfortunately, your body limits how fast you can go- 
you are only human, after all.

Be sure to keep an eye on your surroundings, understand the enemies to avoid, 
and the items to make a run for. Your success is up to you.

Good luck.
