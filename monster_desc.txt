PYROGUE MONSTER DESCRIPTION FILE

A couple of notes: any lines not contained between "BEGIN MONSTER" and "END" will be ignored. So, comments like this are possible.
Monsters will have all of the fields listed below. Playing around will give you a good idea of how these are defined and work within the dungeon.

Probably the most initially confusing aspect will be dice, and how they are defined in this file.
Dice act to randomize the aspects of monsters, and are expressed like 10+2d6, i.e., {base value}+{number of dice / dice rolls}d{Sides to die}.

Other note: COLOR can be specified as multiple colors, which will be randomly looped between. They just need to be any valid Tkinter color keyword.

This is a junior barbarian.  He--or is it she?  You can't tell for sure--
looks like... it should still be in barbarian school.  The barbarians are 
putting them in the dungeons young these days.  It's wearing dirty, tattered
cloth armor and wielding a wooden sword.  You have a hard time feeling
intimidated.

Casper, the friendly ghost, 
The friendliest ghost you know.

Wherever he may go, 
He's kind to every living creature. 

Grown-ups don't understand 
Why children love him the most. 
But kids all know 
That he loves them so, 
Casper the friendly ghost.

Some say that this mystical creature underwent many legendary battles
with one Peter Griffin, causing utter chaos upon the land of Quahog.

Looming over you at a massive 15 feet tall, weighing nearly a ton, the

=========================  DIFFICULT MONSTERS


BEGIN MONSTER
NAME HEV Zombie
DESC
As you stumble through the dungeon, you come across someone wearing their own 
HEV suit. Instinctively, you call out to them, hoping for an ally.

They don't answer, or even seem to acknowledge you.

So, you move in closer, trying to see what is going on. They slowly turn 
around, revealing the headcrab firmly secured on their head.

Their suit croaks out "v-vi-vital ss-ssig-signs critical", clearly losing 
its battle to keep its wearer alive and well.

Your ally hopes are quickly replaced with dread.

NAME Amazon Lich Queen
DESC
She was a powerful Amazon warrior in life.  Death at the hands of the undead
hordes was followed by her resurrection through dark, necromantic arts.  Her
power in life didn't approach her undead glory.  Clad in night-black robes
that don't move in the wind, her incorporeal form commands the power of death
over life.  You may just be her next victim.  You fear for your soul as you
quake before her malevolent majesty.
