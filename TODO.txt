2025 semester started, so PyRogue will take a wayside for a while.
Things left that I want to implement before a full "1.0":
- combat log viewer (visible after death/ game over)
- monster item pickup / destroy abilities
- Monster item drop on death (if possible)
- Make game runable in easy way (no terminal navigation, just launch and play)


Misc
- main menu pages reset to zero scroll on page flip (?)
